<h1>Ideal DH Paper Project</h1>
<p>Digital Humanities is one of the most tremulous, evolving fields of critical discourse across academic departments. This is widely due to the fact that term means something different to everyone and that there is little consensus on what constitutes a digital humanities project or what a digital humanities project should do. In my belief Digital Humanities is an expanding area of scholarship that offers researchers a venue through which actual impact on cultural rhetoric and understanding that has long been guarded within the hallowed halls of academia can be digitally dispersed. It is the responsibility of a digital humanities project to use the allowances of digital interfaces, environments, and mediums to engage with a wider audience through new methods and forms. This is an area where all other forms of academic scholarship are lagging that digital humanities projects are built for. Public engagement, outreach, and education should be fundamental in the development of any DH research endeavor.</p> 
<p>Alongside the crucial need for engagement the ideal digital humanities project would always be understanding of the biases that are inherently attached to the research. Whether this be a historical biases of the collected research or an editorial biases in the association of specific authors or artifacts, digital humanists must inform themselves of their own predispositions. While many might argue that this is something all researchers and academics should engage with, I believe it is even more critical for the digital humanist because of the breadth and reach of our scholarship. As a new turn in academia digital projects must make sure to not burden with them errors of previous scholarship, such as whitewashing history or cherry-picking evidence, that should be left to the bookshelves. In his article “Blunt Instrumentalism: On Tools and Methods” Dennis Tenen argues for the expansion of traditionally defined and valued scholarship to include the maker qualities of digital humanists. He states that “we are much better poised to remain agile, to tinker, and to experiment” and these traits are further amplified by the group, and collective dynamic of digital projects. I agree with Tenen’s evaluation of contemporaries within the digital humanities community and argue that this agility is one of the reasons that digital humanist are so well prepared to develop projects that provide for the public but retain the accountability and prestige of academic discourse. 
</p><p>Another critical component to an ideal digital humanities project, collaborative space is critical in developing the best research agenda, analysis, and arguments. It is through a collective that the best ideas are developed due to the fact that different viewpoints, backgrounds, and knowledge bases all collate together to inform one another. By removing the traditional insular modes of scholarship digital humanities projects are already expanding the definition of what they can accomplish and the more diverse of a team the better informed a project will be. That is why digital projects must make sure to have various genders, race, religions, and cultural backgrounds informing the work in some capacity whether it be through student workers, an advisory board or merely community member input. While it is helpful to have a lot of input on certain aspects of a digital project, like the methodological development, there are areas where too much clutter and opinion can be detrimental to a digital research endeavor.</p> 
<p>Design is a critical aspect in formulating a digital humanities project. Although in traditional scholarship little time was wasted on the book jacket in digital projects the design is definitive of the underlying research and is the user first form of engagement with a site. A digital project that is uncluttered, minimally designed, and pleasing to the eye is critical in engaging with users. If a user is automatically put off by the look of the site they are immediately attaching a bias against visual interpretation against the sites research. Although it seems intuitive for all digital projects to follow web standards for both content curation and design there are still projects that do not take these initial founding steps. In his discussion of universal design as a way for conscious decisions to be made that would allow sites to become widely accessible Williams relates digital design to material practices.</p>
<p>Whether in a physical or a digital environment, designers are always making choices about accessibility. However, not all designers are aware of how their choices affect accessibility. Universal design is design that involves conscious decisions about accessibility for all, and it is a philosophy that should be adopted more widely by digital humanities scholar. 
By creating this type of analogy Williams proves that a mindful, encompassing digital humanities project must be even more aware of accessibility needs because the nature of the web, not the natural world is to be accessible. While Williams argues for design for disabilities he limits his argument to physical disabilities and does not cover all the various forms of digital disabilities. The ideal digital humanities project would be mindful of all users: those with language barriers, users with limited access to internet connectivity, or even just people who are not digital natives.</p>
<p>Although it is very visionary I believe that it is the role of the digital humanist to develop their work, following the best standards and practices, in the hopes of reaching the widest areas of dissemination. While design, as Williams argues, must be accessible I would take his argument a step farther and state that so must the writing and the presentation of the content across mediums. A digital project should make sure to have an extensive “How To Page” that informs users on using and interacting with the site and it is the job of a digital humanist to write in a manner that is accessible across the internet and not written solely for those academically minded. However, while this attention to openness is a necessary component of a great DH project, the more open of a digital project the more necessary it is for the site’s curator to develop monitored spaces for user interaction.</p> 
<p>With anonymity comes the breadth of freedom and there are those internet users who choose to use that freedom to spew their uninformed, racist, harassing beliefs across the internet. Unwanted and unasked these users can be drawn to certain digital humanities projects that are about a specific issue they take fault and want to “troll”. Due to individuals such as these it is now critical for digital humanists to identify codes of conduct for digital spaces. Within “Putting the Human Back into the Digital Humanities: Feminism, Generosity and Mess” by Elizabeth Losh, Jacqueline Wernimont, Laura Wexler and Hong-Au Wu critical examples of safe places within digital humanities, such as FemTechNet that fulfill a need for open, yet mediated modes of discourse, are identified and presented to the readers as model modes of discourse. In defining an ideal form of digital discourse the co-authors first provide examples of unsafe and negative areas of Web 2.0 such as Wikipedia where sexism, racism, and cyber-bullying can run-rampant proves a need for some interventions or policing of space.</p>
<p>While I believe that the writing quartet overemphasizing the predatory nature of online spaces and underestimate a user's ability to mitigate unwanted discourse the need for users to be critically aware of their self across internet interactions and a patroller are both critical to the ideal Digital Humanities project. In order to combat the harmful, disparaging discourse that takes places across unfiltered mediums the article argues that “both niceness and civility do have their defenders among digital humanists seeking community and desiring a disciplinary home without domestic tension.” I believe that the ideal DH project would take into account this need to create a safe, civil space where the research, interpretations, and growth of the project can be discussed openly. Whether this is through the implementation of a user-login based system that can be controlled or a heavily monitored commenting section. An excellent digital humanities projects is mindful not only of how users are interacting with the site but how users are interacting with one another and wants to make sure that user has a safe experience with the site all around.</p>
<p>The epitome of a digital humanities project is one that takes on a variety of influences and is not afraid to alter their development as the research continues. An ideal digital humanist is someone that realizes the ideal digital humanities project cannot be completed alone. Digital Humanities is an area of study that has become collaborative becauses of how many facets go into developing a great digital research endeavor. All of the ideals laid out across this argument would be impossible for one individual to handle alone. Instead, more is asked of a digital humanities project because in every way this form of research encompass more than traditional scholarship. Whether it be attention to design, user interaction, or simply narrative style there are so many components to an ideal digital project that must all harmonize together. While many projects showcased have hit some of the ideal criteria, not one project has been able to do all that I believe digital projects should strive for. And maybe that’s because there is will always be more one thing, even within this short definition I had to pick and choose the most critical aspects. I barely touched on the need for sustainable planning, version control, or fair representation of all credited work all critical components to an ideal project. As is nature of an evolving medium as the digital environment changes so will the requisites of digital humanities research.</p>
